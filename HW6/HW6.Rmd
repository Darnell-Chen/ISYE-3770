## Problem 6.1.6

The sample mean of our data set can be calculated by adding all our values and dividing by the sample size:\\

$\bar{x} = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \approx 14.35895$

On the other hand, our standard deviance is simply the squareroot of our variance $s^2$:

$s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \mu)^2}{n-1} \approx 356.4716$\\
$s = \sqrt{s^2} = \sqrt{356.4716} \approx 18.88045$

Thus, we get a mean of approx. 14.35895 and a standard deviation of approx. 18.88045.

```{r}
times = read.table("6-8.txt", header = TRUE)
times = times$time

mean(times)

var(times)
sqrt(var(times))

## Problem 6.1.6

```{r}
rating = read.table("6-30.txt", header = TRUE)
rating = rating$Rating

rating = sort(rating)
rating

quantiles = quantile(rating,type=6)
quantiles

stem(rating)
